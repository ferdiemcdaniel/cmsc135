#Lab 1 Python Programming Exercises

In this lab exercise, your task is to write 3 functions in Python given the specifications below. Make sure that your 
code is compatible with Python 2. This lab exercise will prepare you for the socket programming exercise which you will do next meeting. 

### Problem 1 - GO → goING

In English, the present participle is formed by adding the suffix -ing to the infinite form: go → going. A simple set of heuristic rules can be given as follows:
- If the verb ends in *e*, drop the *e* and add *ing* (if not exception: be, see, flee, knee, etc.)
- If the verb ends in *ie*, change *ie* to *y* and add *ing*
- For words consisting of consonant-vowel-consonant, double the final letter before adding *ing*
- By default just add *ing*

Your task in this exercise is to define a function `make_ing_form(word)` which given a verb in infinitive form returns its present participle form. Test your function with words such as lie, see, move and hug. However, you must not expect such simple rules to work for all cases.

### Problem 2

Write a function `find_longest_word(words)` that takes a list of words and returns the length
of the longest one.

   
### Problem 3

Write a function `is_member(x, a)` that takes a value (i.e. a number, string, etc) `x` and a list of values `a`, and returns `True` if `x` is a member of `a`, `False` otherwise. (Note that this is exactly what the `in` operator does, but for the sake of the exercise you should pretend Python did not have this operator.)
